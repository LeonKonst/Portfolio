# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Konstantinos (Kostas)!

## Welcome to my portfolio! 

I'm a multidisciplinary researcher and engineer with a strong background in chemical engineering, composite materials, and coatings technology. Beyond my scientific career, I have a passion for technology and problem-solving. Iâ€™ve worked as a freelance sound engineer and lighting technician, blending technical knowledge with creativity. Recently, Iâ€™ve taken on a new challengeâ€”teaching myself web development.
